CFS advises that a serious bushfire is burning out of control at CAP TEST 3 Mount Pleasant in the Adelaide Hills near Melrose Street (Torrens Valley Road) and Talunga Park Road. The MOUNT PLEASANT fire is travelling in a easterly direction towards Showground Road. There is a risk to lives and homes. The uncontrolled fire is burning in Grass. Check and follow your Bushfire Survival Plan. Take shelter before the fire arrives as radiant heat can kill you well before the flames reach you. Only leave if the path is clear to a safe place. You should not enter this area as the roads may not be safe. Well prepared and actively defended homes can offer safety. Stay tuned to our emergency broadcast partners on a battery-powered radio for updates.
